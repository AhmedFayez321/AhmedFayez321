## 🚀 Specialized Engineering Tracks

### 1️⃣ Social Robotics & HRI (Human-Robot Interaction)
**Project:** [Jarvis: Interactive AI Robotic Arm](https://github.com/AhmedFayez321/Jarvis-Robotic-Arm-Showcase)

</p>

* **Track Expertise:** This project pushed me to master **Kinematics** and **Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)**. By integrating **MediaPipe** and **OpenCV**, I moved beyond simple automation to creating a machine that maintains a "Social Presence" through autonomous tracking and gesture recognition. 
* **Key Growth:** I mastered **Multi-threading** in Python to sync live AI data with hardware response, and engineered a custom **Animation Recorder** using **Linear Interpolation** for human-like fluid motion.

### 2️⃣ Control Theory & Algorithmic Optimization
**Project:** [High-Speed Line Follower (Competition Winner)](https://github.com/AhmedFayez321/Line-Follower-Robot)

</p>

* **Track Expertise:** Securing **1st Place out of 134 teams** at RoboCup MICA 2025 was a testament to my ability to innovate under constraints. When standard PID libraries were restricted, I developed my own navigation logic.
* **Key Growth:** I deepened my understanding of **Algorithm Design** by creating a custom state machine based on **Optimized Nested Conditionals**. I also implemented a **Self-Correction Back-tracking algorithm**, proving that I can build robust, "error-aware" systems that survive real-world racing conditions.

### 3️⃣ Mechatronics & Digital Manufacturing (Machines)
**Project:** [Custom Mini CNC PCB Plotter](https://github.com/AhmedFayez321/cnc-machine-3-axis)

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/AhmedFayez321/Mini-CNC-Plotter-Arduino/blob/main/Hardware/Schematics/CNC_Schematic.png" width="80%" alt="CNC Machine Design">
</p>

* **Track Expertise:** This project established my expertise in **Precision Machines**. Building a machine that manufactures other machines (PCBs) required a deep dive into the **Digital-to-Physical pipeline**.
* **Key Growth:** I mastered **G-Code interpretation** and sub-millimeter calibration ($100-$102 parameters). By integrating **FlatCAM (Linux/WSL)** with modified **GRBL firmware**, I gained hands-on experience in industrial manufacturing workflows and high-torque stepper motor control.

---

### 4️⃣ Full-Stack IoT & System Reliability
**Project:** [IoT Smart Home System (ESP-01 & Firebase)](https://github.com/AhmedFayez321/Smart-Home-System)

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/AhmedFayez321/IoT-Smart-Home-System/blob/main/Media/Image1.png" width="80%" alt="IoT System Dashboard">
</p>

* **Track Expertise:** Reliability is the soul of IoT. This system has been operational in a real-world environment for **over 1.5 years without downtime**, proving my ability to build "Production-Ready" solutions.
* **Key Growth:** I mastered **Full-Stack IoT development**, from hardware safety (AC power regulation) to cloud backend (Firebase) and cross-platform frontend (KivyMD/Android). It showcases my ability to manage real-time data synchronization across diverse devices.
