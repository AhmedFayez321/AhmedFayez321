# Hi there, I’m Ahmed Fayez 👋

**Artificial Intelligence Student | Robotics & Embedded Systems Enthusiast**

I am a senior student at **Misr International Computer & AI Academy (MICA)**, graduating in 2026. I specialize in bringing complex ideas to life at the intersection of Hardware, Embedded Systems, and AI. I have a proven track record of building end-to-end prototypes, from mechanical design to cloud integration.
